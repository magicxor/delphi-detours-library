This project contians two sub projects : **The Detours Library** and **the InstDecode library** .

The InstDecode Library is a library that can decode both (x86-x64) instructions .You can consider it as a small disassembler routine .
It can decode instruction and getting information about the instruction (size of instruction,displacement,immediate data, jump address,..) without displaying mnemonics making it very faster and small in compiled size.

This two library was coded in pure pascal language with delphi XE7.

See the [Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/delphi-detours-library/w/list) page for more information about how to use the library .
